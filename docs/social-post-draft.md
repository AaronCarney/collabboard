We built CollabBoard: a real-time collaborative whiteboard that reimagines how teams work together.

**What it is:** A browser-based whiteboard where teams sketch, design, and brainstorm in real time. Add sticky notes, shapes, connectors, and frames. Invite collaborators with view or edit access. See live cursors and presence updates from everyone in the room.

**The AI twist:** Type natural language commands and CollabBoard generates what you need. "Create a SWOT analysis" spins up a template. "Add a kanban board with product roadmap items" builds it instantly. Powered by GPT-4o-mini, these commands turn whiteboarding from manual drawing into guided creation.

**Built right:** CollabBoard was developed using AI-assisted TDD and Claude Code. Every feature is tested -- 445 unit and integration tests across 107 source files. 46 commits of careful, intentional development. The tech stack: Next.js 14, Supabase for real-time sync, Clerk for auth, Canvas 2D for rendering.

**Why it matters:** Synchronous collaboration over digital whiteboards is broken -- tools are either clunky or lack presence. CollabBoard bridges that gap with real-time updates, intuitive UI, and AI that understands what you're trying to build, not just what you're trying to draw.
